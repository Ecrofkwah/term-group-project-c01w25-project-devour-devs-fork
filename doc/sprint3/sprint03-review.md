# DEVOUR DEVS/RECIPECONNECT

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Wednesday, March 19, 2024
 * Where: Online via Zoom
 * Participants: Michael, Ivy, Daniyal, Kushal, William
## Process - Reflection

In this meeting we discussed the work distributions, hurdles of each member, and how to move forward to complete our project.

#### Decisions that turned out well

- Focusing on high-level features
  - By focusing on high-level features, our product now stands out incomparably more than the previous iteration, with practical and useful features such as AI step-by-step summarization, nutrient estimation, etc.
- Clearly dividing tasks:
  - Originally, some of the task distribution was vague so we discussed it and clearly distributed tasks to each member. As a result, everyone knew what to focus on and got more work done.
- Assigning story point estimates early:
  - In the previous sprint, we assigned the user story points a few days after the sprint started. As a result, the burndown chart was non-functional.
  - As we assigned them early, we had a better idea of how much time/effort would be required for each task and if each feature could be feasibly completed by the deadline.
  - Since the burndown chart is now functional, we also have access to useful metrics such as team velocity this sprint.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Being too ambitious:
  - We tried to divide-and-conquer, each tackling a difficult task by the end of the sprint.
  - As we aimed for more than we could accomplish, multiple features were barely finished in time.
  - If we instead aimed more reasonably, we could have multiple people working on a difficult feature and thus more reliably deliver completed features.
- Assigning whole sections of the app to each person:
  - As the assignment was very polar, team members were sometimes unknowledgeable about how a certain part of the app functioned, resulting in even more lack of collaboration

#### Planned changes
- None for next sprint. We will do our best improve our product by the end of the sprint.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
- Voice transcription for AI chat:
    - Userstory (done): As a user, I want to be able to talk to my AI assistant so it can help me without manually typing.
- AI step-by-step, AI chat:
    - Userstory (done): As a beginner cook, I want step-by-step guidance or an AI assistant to help me learn how to cook.
- Nutrient estimator:
    - Userstory: As a health-conscious user, I want to upload a picture of my meal so the app can analyze its nutritional content and record my intake.
    - This was not in the original iteration plan.
    - Given an uploaded image, estimate its nutrients.
- Meal planner:
    - Userstory (done): As a user, I want a “Meal Planner” tab so that I can create, view, and manage my weekly meal plans.
- Ingredient suggestions:
    - Userstory (done): As someone who often has leftovers, I want an ingredients-based recipe suggestion so that food doesn’t go to waste.
- Meal planner randomization:
    - Userstory: As a user that struggles to decide what to eat, I want to be able to randomize my meals based on their category (breakfast, lunch, dinner).
    - This was not in the original iteration plan.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- CI/CD pipeline:
    - This is a large task and it was mostly assigned to one person to get started on, so it could not be completed.
    - No userstory, it's a development task.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
- We should aim to finish off our product.
- Polish the app through UI improvements.
- Focus on NFR since most features are complete.
