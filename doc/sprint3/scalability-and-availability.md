# Scalability & Availability Considerations for Recipe MERN App

## 1. Handling Increased Users or Data

As the Recipe MERN app grows in terms of users and the amount of recipe data, we will focus on scaling the database to handle increased traffic and data:

- **Database Scaling**: We plan to use **MongoDB Atlas**, a cloud-based database service. MongoDB Atlas automatically helps scale the database. This ensures that the database can handle a large number of recipes and users without slowing down. 

## 2. Caching Strategies

To ensure fast performance and a good user experience, we will implement **caching** strategies:

- **Client-side Caching (Local Storage)**: We will use **local storage** on users' browsers to store frequently accessed recipe data. For example, popular or recently viewed recipes can be stored in the browser’s local storage, so the app doesn’t need to reload the same data from the backend every time. This makes the app faster and reduces the number of requests to the backend.
