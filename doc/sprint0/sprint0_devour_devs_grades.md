## product.md (Max 36 marks)
  - Project objectives have been specified clearly (max 5 marks)   
    - 5marks = clearly
    - 2 mark  = somewhat clearly
    - 0 marks = not at all
    Your mark: 3, goals are pretty scattered, and there are too many objectives. This is a common pitfall of building “one-stop-shop” type applications. It’s difficult to align your product on a single focus point. Also some parts are a little unclear: “we would offer step-by-step or AI guidance”, would the AI be like real time support? Or will it just generate step by step?


  - Key users have been identified clearly (max 2 marks) 
    - 2 marks = clearly
    - 1 mark  = somewhat clearly
    - 0 marks = not at all
    Your mark: 2


  - Scenarios have been described clearly (max 5 marks)    
    - 5 marks = clearly
    - 2 mark  = somewhat clearly
    - 0 marks = not at all
    Your mark: 3, due to there being a lot of features, some scenarios are unclear.
    
    
  - Market research has been done (max 5marks)
    - 5 marks = to a high degree
    - 2 mark = to an acceptable degree
    - 0 marks = not at all
    Your mark = 2, Need to cite sources (at least provide a link). Some of the justification for why someone would use your product is driven by opinion rather than fact. Someone could argue that a simplistic search is preferable than a platform with thousands of search parameters (I know I’d definitely prefer the former).
    
  - The idea is feasible and students could realistically finish an MVP during the course of the semester (max 5 marks)
    - 5 marks = to a high degree
    - 2 mark = to an acceptable degree
    - 0 marks = not at all
    Your mark: 1, There are a ton of CRUD features which would make this very time consuming and difficult to test. From experience these projects tend to take a long time. Additionally, how do you plan on aggregating and indexing all of these recipes and search parameters? Similarly for the finance features, how will you reliably query pricing for ingredients and other produce.
    
  - The idea is novel , it shows a level of thought and creativity (max 5 marks)
    - 5 marks = to a high degree
    - 2 mark = to an acceptable degree
    - 0 marks = not at all
    Your mark = 1, Mostly just taking a lot of existing features and putting it into one platform. 
    














  - The idea has business potential (max 2 marks)

    - 2 mark  = Somewhat relevant and does not apply to all stories
