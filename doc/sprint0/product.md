#### Q1: What are you planning to build?
RecipeConnect is a recipe sharing website that prioritizes maximum convenience for users. Our goal is to create a one-size-fits-all platform for finding recipes that addresses as many problems as possible for users who hate the hassle of finding a fitting recipe. However, we have also included some additional features catered towards university students, focused on saving money and learning how to cook.

For users looking for specific recipes, we would offer the ability to search based on name, ingredients, difficulty level, cleanup required, calories, cuisine, and more. Essentially being as specific as possible with the search options, which allows the user to find exactly what they are looking for without needing to look through recipes to see if they're a good fit.

For beginner cooks who find common recipes too daunting and not thorough enough, we would offer step-by-step or AI guidance and the ability to search for beginner recipes.

Users that struggle with finances would benefit from many of our product's features. RecipeConnect provides shopping suggestions for cheap ingredients, meal plans following a budget, and a search filter option for cost of recipe.

For recipe writers looking to share their recipes, RecipeConnect provides an easy to use recipe builder that saves their recipes and provides automatic data such as nutrients, cost, and difficulty.

As for those with limited ingredients, we would offer ingredient substitution suggestions and a virtual pantry to track ingredients. The virtual pantry can be used to search for matching recipes, and suggesting ingredients to buy.

Many people looking for recipes are trying to eat healthier as opposed to unhealthy fast-food and/or takeout so they've decided to cook their own meals. Our product provides nutritional information for each recipe, easy serving size customization, healthy alternative ingredient suggestions, and filtering by calories.

Overall, RecipeConnect seeks to make every part of the recipe/cooking process as smooth as possible by assisting in virtually every inconvenience that may occur.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)
On a broader scale, every single home cook would benefit from using our product. We have helpful features for people of all skill levels and living situations. However, our key users would be university students, and since we go to utsc, the students here are a good target demographic (our more general target would be all university students, though).

One specific persona that product could attract is a student living in the campus dorm, with limited cooking equipment, ingredients, and experience. They would be newly living on their own and may find it overwhelming or intimidating to start cooking. This user would appreciate beginner-oriented step-by-step guides and ingredient substitution suggestions for quick and easy to prep meals.

Another might be a student (again, with limited cooking experience) looking to eat healthier, loathing the lack of healthy food options on campus. They're currently on a weight-loss journey which requires that they track the nutritional information(calories, in particular) of the food. They would appreciate a way to find healthy meals, and ingredient substitutions to make their meals healthier.

A student may also be very busy juggling school and a part-time job simultaneously, not having time to cook nutritious meals. This student would likely be eating microwaved frozen foot or takeout. Due to lack of time to experiment, they would be intimidated to start cooking; they don't have the time to be messing up recipes and making food horrors. This student would appreciate quick, easy, and especially cheap, meals while saving saving money on ingredients.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
Potential users currently have a few options. By simply searching "lasagna recipe," the first result that came up was this: https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/lasagna/. Looking through the site, it's a blog site so there's a lot of unnecessary text and clutter that users may not be interested in, such as an introductory text and explaining the thought process behind the recipe. There's also an excess of images that take up space on the screen. In comparison, there's already a precedent for user-generated recipe sharing platforms to be straight and to the point; no fluff nor filler. As an example for this, I searched for a random recipe sharing platform and found this: http://www.sharerecipes.com/recipes/agua-de-jamaica/. The recipe is direct without any clutter. Thus, there are many users that would choose to use an accessible recipe sharing platform over just searching for recipes on the internet.

As for why a user would choose our recipe sharing platform over others, our numerous quality-of-life features make RecipeConnect much more convenient and time-saving than others. Looking at sharerecipes.com and cookpad.com (the two top results from a google search), their search filters are very limited, only searching by title and ingredients. In cookpad, users have bypassed this by including tags such as "easy" and "vegan" in the title, but this runs into problems with the search. For example: When searching for "difficult", recipes that include "not difficult" in the title are included. Users also aren't completely sure which tags to add, so the recipes end up barely classified. In contrast, RecipeConnect's large number of tags makes it extremely easy to both classify recipes and search for perfectly matching recipes. Instead of needing to search through recipes to find one that actually fit what you searched for, only perfectly matching recipes show up.

Additionally, our other features such as serving size adjustment and ingredient substitution are convenient as it allows the user to get everything they need to be successful from only one place, rather than needing to open up many different websites to accomplish the same task.

According to market.us, "the Global Recipe App Market size is expected to be worth around USD 2,268 Million By 2033, from USD 667.3 Million in 2023." It's clear people like following others' recipes. Why choose RecipeConnect? RecipeConnect includes every tool a user would need to create their perfect meal; it is simply better than any alternative.

#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 
If as a user, I can easily and reliably accomplish the goal of the userstory by using the feature, then the feature is done. This is the definition our team agreed upon.

### Highlights
 Our team met once per week for around 2 hours to plan and discuss the project, and had slack meetings to discuss progress on sprint0. We organized the team using google docs and jira. 
 
 One possible product we were considering is "Clutch", an anonymous female product sharing app (tampons and other). The app would allow users to anonymously request supplies, and when the request is taken it would connect users through real-time chat to meet up. This seemed to be a practical idea with a lot of potential.  We decided not to go with this idea as we were unsure if we could give it proper justice within the time constraint of the project, ie. implement it thoroughly without bugs. We also felt there was a lack of flexibility for implementing additional features.

 Another possible product we considered was a financial tracker. We could implement features such as budgeting, tracking spending, and graphs to show data over time. However, we felt that this idea was too generic and common. There wasn't any room for innovative ideas and no particular target audience.

 In the end, we decided to go with RecipeConnect because there are a lot of directions we can go with in terms of creative features, we can implement it properly within the timeline given, and it has a specific target demographic that we can cater towards. In fact, this idea would be useful to us on a personal level which is another large incentive.
