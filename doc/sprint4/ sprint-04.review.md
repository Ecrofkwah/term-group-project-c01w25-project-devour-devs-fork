 * Where: Online via Zoom
 * Participants: Michael, Ivy, Daniyal, Kushal, William
## Process - Reflection

In this meeting we discussed the work distributions, task estimation process and task breakdown into subtask for easier task mangement linear progess tracking.

#### Decisions that turned out well
- Task Breakdown:
  - Originally, our tasks were not broken down into subtasks which left for some abstract goals.
  - By breaking down the stories into subtasks we were able to clearly understand exactly what was expected of each of us.
- Collaborating on features:
  - In the previous sprints, we did not work together much on features/deliverables. By working together, we were able to overcome hurdles and deliver features on time by approaching problems from a new perspective.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Lack of communication/understanding for some of the sprint requirements (Putting off misunderstandings to later):
  - There was some lack of understanding of what exactly we needed to do, and we did not immediately tackle the problem
  - As a result, some important decisions were made last minute
- Focusing on features over other necessities
  - Initially, we put more focus on implementing as many features as we could by the end of the sprint.
  - However, we already had enough features so we should've focused on things like testing, polishing, and NFRs.

#### Planned changes
- None for next sprint (There is no next sprint). We will try to polish our product and test it well.

## Product - Review
